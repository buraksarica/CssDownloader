{"name":"Cssdownloader","tagline":"Just downloads the given css with all the images or files referenced files in it. ","body":"CssDownloader\r\n=============\r\n\r\nCSSDownloader is a simple app written in c#. It does one simple thing: downloads the given css file with images referenced in it.\r\n\r\nUsage is simple too. just open command prompt and type \r\n\r\n  cssd http://www.example.com/yourCssFile.css\r\n  \r\nand the app will download the css file with images, in a folder named same as the file.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of things to do such as:\r\n\r\n* App will download the css file and contents in the same folder of application itself. Maybe it should download to current directory?\r\n* Html support. Users should provide a url of an html and the app should find all the css files, and do the same job (downloading images) for each.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy i wrote an application for that?\r\n====================================\r\nBecause i am using windows, and don't want to install either cygwin etc. to use wget. And also i don't want to install firefox browser.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
